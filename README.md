# PlayStation Startup Remake

A remake of the famous PlayStation startup in HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

## Responsive

This project has been created to be responsive as much as possible. This means that the animation will work on any screen resolution.

**But keep in mine that resizing your window AFTER starting the animation will break some elements.**

## Technologies

To create this PlayStation animation remake, I used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* jQuery UI (required for some animations)

## Using the project

* Clone the project, or download and extract it.
* Go in the folder which contains the project's files.
* Double-click on `index.html` (or open it manually with your preferred web browser)
* Enjoy!
